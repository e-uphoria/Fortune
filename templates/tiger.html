        <h2>What Does the Year 2025 Have in Store for Tigers?</h2>
        <p>

            In 2025, the tiger’s Chinese horoscope may initially feel constrained by the snake’s emphasis on careful planning, introspection, and calculated moves. However, the Tiger Chinese Horoscope 2025 says there might be some challenges, especially those related to “Tai Sui” (the god of Age) issues. Tigers might find it difficult with people at work through gossip and social life. But this is a peculiar year of growth, learning, and success for the Tiger if he can harness his strengths and adapt to the prevailing energies of the Snake.
